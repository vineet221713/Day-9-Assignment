Qustion 3 --- Why is multiple inheritance not supported in Java at class level

Ans ---

Multiple Inheritance is a feature of an object-oriented concept,
 where a class can inherit properties of more than one parent class.
  The problem occurs when there exist methods with the same signature in both the superclasses and subclass.
  On calling the method,
 the compiler cannot determine which class method to be called and even on calling which class method gets the priority.

 Ex--
          GrandParent
           /     \
          /       \
      Parent1      Parent2
          \       /
           \     /
             Test

             It is just to remove the ambiguity ,
              because multiple inheritance can cause ambiguity around Diamond problem in few scenarios.
              For example, if you have two parent classes, they might have different implementations of the same feature
              â€” or possibly two different features with the same name.
               Then you have to deal with deciding which one your subclass is going to use.
               There are ways of handling this, but the designers of Java felt that multiple inheritance causes more problems and confusion than it solves.
                So they avoid multiple inheritance from the Java language.
